## 🧑‍💻 Development Journey

### Why Supabase?

Initially, I planned to build the backend from scratch to demonstrate my full-stack capabilities. However, due to the tight deadline, I decided to use **Supabase** to accelerate development. Supabase provided a robust backend solution with features like authentication, database management, and realtime functionality, allowing me to focus on building the core features of the platform.

### Challenges Faced

- **Realtime Features**: Implementing realtime like/dislike and comment functionality required careful integration with Supabase's realtime capabilities.
- **Unit Testing**: I attempted to add unit tests, but mocking Supabase's behavior proved to be time-consuming. This is an area I plan to improve in the future.
- **SEO Optimization**: Ensuring the platform was SEO-friendly required leveraging Next.js's SSR and optimizing metadata.
